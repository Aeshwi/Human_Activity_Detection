# Human Activity Recognition Project

## About The Project

Human activity recognition involves interpreting human motion through computer vision techniques. This project focuses on categorizing human motion into various activities using data collected from electromagnetic and angular velocity sensors. The collected data is translated into identifiable actions or behaviors. The objective is to analyze these activities and develop machine learning models to classify human motions into six distinct activities.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle.

## Activity Types

The dataset defines the following activities:

- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING

## Developed Models

The following machine learning models have been developed for activity classification:

- Na√Øve Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
